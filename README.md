# dont-call-me-turkey
In this kaggle competition, we need to predict if a given audio clip has turkey word in it. 
Audio clips are preprocessed into numeric arrays and provided in data. 
I did EDA, feature engineering and trained 4 classifiers - XGBoost, LightGBM, Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier 
The notebook is uploaded here
